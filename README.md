# Time Series Analysis Projects (STAT 153 - UC Berkeley)

This repository contains a collection of time series analysis projects completed as part of the course **STAT 153: Introduction to Time Series** at **UC Berkeley**. Each project applies a different class of time series models or techniques to real or simulated data, covering both classical statistical methods and modern approaches.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following Jupyter notebooks:

### üìÅ [proj01_multiple_linear_model.ipynb](./proj01_multiple_linear_model.ipynb)
**Topic**: Multiple Linear Regression for Time Series  
- Applied multiple linear regression to model time series data with deterministic components.
- Included lagged variables and time trends as predictors.
- Demonstrated understanding of residual analysis, interpretation of model coefficients, and basic forecasting.

### üìÅ [proj02_spectral_analysis.ipynb](./proj02_spectral_analysis.ipynb)
**Topic**: Sinusoidal Model Fitting, Spectral Analysis and Fourier Methods  
- Conducted sinusoidal model fitting for time series analysis.
- Used **Fourier transformations** and **spectral density estimation** to analyze cyclical components in time series data.
- Interpreted periodograms and smoothed spectra to detect dominant frequencies.
- Applied windowing techniques and discussed the effects of aliasing and leakage.

### üìÅ [proj03_changepoint_regularization.ipynb](./proj03_changepoint_regularization.ipynb)
**Topic**: Change Point Detection and Piecewise Models  
- Detected **structural breaks** in time series using change point analysis.
- Built **piecewise linear models** to capture changes in trend.
- Explored **regularization techniques** (such as ridge regression) to stabilize estimation under multicollinearity and overfitting.

### üìÅ [proj04_autoregressive_model.ipynb](./proj04_autoregressive_model.ipynb)
**Topic**: Autoregressive (AR) Models  
- Estimated and validated **AR(p)** models.
- Evaluated stationarity, ACF/PACF plots, and used **Yule-Walker equations**.
- Compared model orders using information criteria (AIC/BIC) and forecast accuracy.

### üìÅ [proj05_arima_seasonal.ipynb](./proj05_arima_seasonal.ipynb)
**Topic**: ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA Models  
- Fitted **ARIMA** and **SARIMA** models to both simulated and real-world data.
- Applied **differencing** to achieve stationarity.
- Conducted model diagnostics and generated multi-step ahead forecasts.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- üìà **Model Fitting**: Experience fitting regression-based and stochastic models to time series data.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Spectral Analysis**: Proficient in interpreting and applying Fourier-based methods.
- üîÄ **Change Point Analysis**: Detecting structural changes and adapting models accordingly.
- üîÅ **ARIMA Modeling**: Full pipeline from model identification to validation and forecasting.
- üíª **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: Applied RNN models such as long short term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU) for forecasting.

## About
This repository reflects my learning journey through UC Berkeley's STAT 153 course, emphasizing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of core time series methods.
I shall express sincere thankfulness and appreciation for Professor Aditya Guntuboyina's clear, elaborate and excellent instructions on the selected topics of Time Series Analysis.
